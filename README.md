# Time Series Forecasting and Modeling

This repository contains various time series forecasting models and their implementations. The focus is on classic statistical models, including AR, MA, ARMA, SARIMA, and GARCH, applied to both basic datasets and real-world financial data. The repository also explores advanced techniques such as VAR, PACF, and ACF.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of several time series forecasting and modeling techniques:

- **AR (AutoRegressive)**
- **MA (Moving Average)**
- **ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average)**
- **SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
- **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)**

Additionally, it includes exploratory analysis with:

- **VAR (Vector AutoRegression)**
- **PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function)**
- **ACF (Autocorrelation Function)**

The models are applied to both basic datasets for learning purposes and to stock market data sourced from Yahoo Finance for forecasting applications.

## Features

- **Basic Dataset Analysis**: Implements AR, MA, ARMA, SARIMA, and GARCH models on simple, synthetic data to demonstrate fundamental concepts.
- **Stock Market Forecasting**: Uses ARMA and GARCH models to predict stock prices based on historical data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Applies VAR, PACF, and ACF for advanced time series analysis on basic datasets.


#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Necessary Python libraries (numpy, pandas, statsmodels, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, yfinance, arch)


#### Credits

Special thanks to **RitvikMath** for introducing the concepts and providing a foundational model for implementation. His videos helped me understand these time series forecasting techniques.
